<h3>Little Miss Sunshine</h3>
Great acting and the main melody played throughout tears at the heartstrings
<h3>Practical Magic</h3>
Ugh- I love the sisterhood! I would happily watch more of this movie and universe. Plus, the main meoldy is so light and lovely!
<h3>Jumanji</h3>
Very funny movie! And Jack Black did amazing- wonderful comedic timing while still acting true to character!
